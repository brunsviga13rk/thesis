// Antikythera
Around 60 #gls("BC", long: false), in the straits between Crete and the
Peloponnese, a merchant ship sank off the coast of Aigila. Among the cargo of
the merchant ship which carried silver and bronze coins, was a special
mechanical device. The device, named after today's name of the nearby island of
Antikythera, was an astronomical calculator able to approximate the position of
celestial bodies such as the Sun and the then known 5 planets of our solar
system. Additionally the machine served as calendar and could be used to
describe solar and lunar eclipse cycles. This gear-based device is the oldest
known analog computer to date. Unfortunately, only a third of the original
Antikythera has survived and what is left is split over 82 fragments.
@fig:antikythera shows one fragment with the largest gear in the mechanism of
about 13 cm in diameter.

// Blaise Pascal
As can be seen, the history of mechanical computers can be traced back by
several hundreds of years.
It would be about a thousand years before European watchmakers were able to
produce mechanical machines of similar complexity.
Major development in automating computational tasks
can be attributed to several reasons. In 1642 the french mathematician Blaise
Pascal invented a mechanical calculator at the age of 18, in order to help his
father with tax calculations. His machine is able of addition and subtraction
alike. The machine made use of base ten and was able to automatically carry
the overflows of one digit to the next.
Due to cost of production Pascal's invention was never mass produced.

// Leibniz
Inspired by Blaise's "Pascaline" the german mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm von
Leibniz build his first calculator known today as "step reckoner".
This calculator is known recognized as the first "true" four function
calculator capable of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
Leibniz used drum-shaped gears in his machine which would prove to be very
influential in the design of later mechanical calculators. Unfortunately Leibniz
failed to built a fully functional machine within his lifetime. Despite that
several replicas of his machine find their way into exhibitions about the
history of compute and it is believed that Leibniz was well ahead of his time.

// Arithmometer
The first commercially available machine calculator was
constructed by french Charles Xavier Thomas in 1820. The Arithmometer, as the
machine was called, became widely successful in selling. While the machine at
its core relies on the same drum-shaped gear as Leibniz machine, it exceeds his
original design in terms of complexity. The machine gained widespread use in the
insurance world allowing for reduced error in computation by avoiding erroneous
calculation done by hand. The commercialization of Thomas's calculator in 1852
started the calculating machine industry in the world.

In the early 1870s a swedish engineer by the name of Willgodt Theophil Odhner
started to invent calculating machines. He planed to improve family fortunes
by selling said machines. By 1877 foruteen machines were already built.
In contrast to the drum-shaped gear of the Arithmometer invented by Charles
Xavier Thomas, Odhner used a wheel spicked with retractable pins to represent a
digit. These amount of pins portruding out of the pinwheel were adjustable
through a lever. Combined with a counter these pinwheels were capable of
addition.
