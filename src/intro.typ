// Antikythera
Around 60 #gls("BC", long: false), in the straits between Crete and the
Peloponnese, a merchant ship sank off the coast of Aigila. Among the cargo of
the merchant ship which carried silver and bronze coins, was a special
mechanical device. The device, named after today's name of the nearby island of
Antikythera, was an astronomical calculator able to approximate the position of
celestial bodies such as the Sun and the then known 5 planets of our solar
system. Additionally, the machine served as calendar and could be used to
describe solar and lunar eclipse cycles. This gear-based device is the oldest
known analog computer to date. Unfortunately, only a third of the original
Antikythera has survived and what is left is split over 82 fragments.
@fig:antikythera shows one fragment with the largest gear in the mechanism of
about 13 cm in diameter.

// Blaise Pascal
As can be seen, the history of mechanical computers can be traced back by
several hundreds of years.
It would be about a thousand years before European watchmakers were able to
produce mechanical machines of similar complexity.
Major development in automating computational tasks
can be attributed to several reasons. In 1642 the French mathematician Blaise
Pascal invented a mechanical calculator at the age of 18, in order to help his
father with tax calculations. His machine is able of addition and subtraction
alike. The machine made use of base ten and was able to automatically carry
the overflows of one digit to the next.
Due to cost of production Pascal's invention was never mass-produced.

// Leibniz
Inspired by Blaise's "Pascaline" the German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm von
Leibniz build his first calculator known today as "step reckoner".
This calculator is known recognized as the first "true" four function
calculator capable of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
Leibniz used drum-shaped gears in his machine which would prove to be very
influential in the design of later mechanical calculators. Unfortunately Leibniz
failed to build a fully functional machine within his lifetime. Despite that
several replicas of his machine find their way into exhibitions about the
history of compute, and it is believed that Leibniz was well ahead of his time.

// Arithmometer
The first commercially available machine calculator was
constructed by french Charles Xavier Thomas in 1820. The Arithmometer, as the
machine was called, became widely successful in selling. While the machine at
its core relies on the same drum-shaped gear as Leibniz machine, it exceeds his
original design in terms of complexity. The machine gained widespread use in the
insurance world allowing for reduced error in computation by avoiding erroneous
calculation done by hand. In fact, as supervisor of two insurance companies,
Charles had significant staff costs due to the amount computations required to
run the company. He invented the machine in hopes of reducing these expenses by
enhancing human labor with mechanical calculators.
The commercialization of Thomas's calculator in 1852
started the calculating machine industry in the world and dominated said over
the span of nearly fifty years.

// Willgodt Theophil Odhner
Between the years 1868 and 1869 the Swedish engineer Willgodt Theophil Odhner
immigrated to Russia where he was hired by Ludvig Nobel to work at an arms
factory. His responsibility volved around fixing the Arithmometers invented by
Charles Xavier Thomas half a century ago.
In the early 1870s Odhner planed to improve family fortunes
by selling said machines. For this purpose he partnered with Karl Königsberger,
a German merchant. Karl filed multiple patents in Germany in the year 1878.
The patent for Odhners was eventually bought by the German sewing
machine firm @GNC. in 1892. Through the modernization of
administration and office buildings at the end of the 19th century due to a
growing population and economy the need for more
efficient calculations through the use of machines was rising in Germany.
Already in July 1892 engineer and head of @GNC Franz Trinks presented the
machine built using the patents bought from Königsberger as "Brunsviga".

@GNC specialized in making the "Brunsviga" a cheap and simple to produce in an
industrialized manner allowing for mass production. The machine was redesigned
for easier use by less qualified people. Alongside an aggressive marketing
campaign the company managed to sell 500 pieces within a year.
The company continued to grow and developed nine models of its "Brunsviga"
calculator. Even during World War 1 production was not put on hold.
In 1921 @GNC was restructured into a shares company and by 1927 the firm was
renamed to "Brunsviga Maschinen Werke, Grimme, Natalis & Co. AG"
