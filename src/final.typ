= Final words

The functionality of the Brunsvgia keeps amazing due to its stability.
Despite being purely mechanical and the model used for this project being over
half a century old, the device functions without issue.
It is well noticeable that even during engineering the analog nature
was considered as the machine consists of so many locking mechanism that
is becomes tricky to break the machine during normal operation.
Working with the machine this up close leaves nothing but astonishment
for all the engineering that went into producing this machine.
But this complicated nature also made it challenging to accurately
model the machine. The produced model is quite complex with many
edges, rounded surfaces and movable parts.
It was a tricky task to develop methods to properly unwrap the model
to maximize texture usage while giving the most visible parts of the machine
enough resolution to properly fit the materials details (see @sec:unwrapping).
Perhaps it comes as a surprise that the modelling of animations
during this project was overall the easiest part of the deal due to their
simple nature. Probably due to good user experience design by the manufacturer
made the interaction with the machine physically easy which in turn
made a recreation more easily achievable.
Unfortunately, as is often the case, the greatest enemy was time itself.
Due to time constraints some initially planed features such as sounds
remain unimplemented. It is also due to this reason that
the simulation is still lacking in visual quality as explained in @sec:passes.
This is certainly an area sure to improve in upcoming versions.
Even the calculation solver lacks a set of features. Division, while recognized
and parsed by syntax is unimplemented and will cause errors.
It was also planned to add function performing crude approximations for trigonometric
functions such as sine or even a square root.

Thanks to Prof. Dr. Bauer for his support during
the project and also to two former owners of Brunsviga machines that where bought
for live reference purposes. Without these this project would not have seen
all the success it now has. Having physical machines to pull on was
a great motivation and the best source of reference in this Project.
