= Digital twin

At the core of this entire project is the simulation of a real-world physical
object. Mechanical machinery is best understood when viewed through animations
showing each step of process. Multiplication on the Brunsvgia for example is
generally a multistep procedure. Having a model to virtually orbit around
benefits understanding. For the purpose of rendering the calculator on a
computer screen, a digital recreation of the calculating machine is required.
This 3d model will be referred to as "digital twin" a term used in by the
automation industry to monitor, test and verify various parts of factories
such as assembly lines. Although the use case diverges from those of the major
industries, as this project does not center around any of the more commonly used
goals of data analysis, cost estimation nor are the physical and the digital
twins linked by sensor data or network connection. As the object of interest
is a purely analog computing device there are no networks or sensors to connect.
This digital twin is used entirely for educational purposes in order to deepen
and preserve the understanding of the history of calculators as they were used
decades ago.
